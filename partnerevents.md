Speaker: [Professor Nick Horton, Amherst College](https://www.amherst.edu/people/facstaff/nhorton)
Presentation Title: “Introductory Statistics in a World of Data Science: Where We Are and Where We Need to Head”
Date and Time:  Tuesday, September 25, 2018; 4:30 – 6:30 PM 
Location:  Brown University School of Public Health,  121 South Main Street, Providence, RI 02903. 
Cost: $6 for students; $12 for non-students. 
Registration: http://bcasa2018horton.eventbrite.com. Registration requested by September 21. 

<i>Abstract:</i> This is an exciting time for the broader statistics profession, with a flood of data available in myriad domains and an increased focus on the importance of data literacy and data science. There continues to be growth in the number of students taking statistics courses and the development of many innovative data science courses. This talk will survey the landscape of introductory statistics and biostatistics courses in an era of data science, and address questions regarding the role of computation, how to balance the needs of general education students and future statistics and data science students, the role of the statistical analysis cycle, pathways to support student success, faculty development, and the relationships between high school and college preparation. These developments have important implications not just for educators but for practitioners and researchers as well.</p>

Abstract: 
Missing data is a common complication in applied research. Although most practitioners are still ignoring the missing data problem, numerous books and research articles demonstrate that dealing with it correctly is very important. Biased results and inefficient estimates are just some of the risks of incorrectly dealing with incomplete data. In this course, we will introduce incomplete data vocabulary and present problems and solutions to the missing data issue. We will emphasize practical implementation of the proposed strategies including discussion of software to implement procedures for incomplete data.
About the instructor:

Presentation Abstract:
Technological advancements in the field of mobile devices and wearable sensors make it possible to deliver treatments anytime and anywhere to users like you and me. Increasingly the delivery of these treatments is triggered by detections/predictions of vulnerability and receptivity. These observations are likely to have been impacted by prior treatments. Furthermore, the treatments are often designed to have an impact on users over a span of time during which subsequent treatments may be provided. Here we discuss our work on the design of a mobile health smoking cessation study in which the above two challenges arose. This work involves the use of multiple online data analysis algorithms. Online algorithms are used in the detection, for example, of physiological stress. Other algorithms are used to forecast at each vulnerable time, the remaining number of vulnerable times in the day. These algorithms are then inputs into a randomization algorithm that ensures that each user is randomized to each treatment an appropriate number of times per day. We develop the stratified micro-randomized trial which involves not only the randomization algorithm but a precise statement of the meaning of the treatment effects and the primary scientific hypotheses along with primary analyses and sample size calculations. Considerations of causal inference and potential causal bias incurred by inappropriate data analyses play a large role throughout.
