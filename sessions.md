    <summary><h3 style="display:inline-block">Challenges, Opportunities, and Myths in Data Science</h3></summary>

    This plenary session serves as the introduction to the Summit. As nutrition is a diverse and complex discipline, it should be met with equally as diverse review of possible data science methodologies to solve its problems. Efforts by Boston area universities to address this complexity across various subdisciplines in nutrition will be highlighted. Speakers from various institution and disciplines will offer insights into interdisciplinary collaborations and highlight the need for interdisciplinary <b>connection, coordination, collaboration, and creativity.</b>

  <summary><h3 style="display:inline-block">Nutrition Data Sharing</h3></summary>
  
  Though NGOs, government agencies, and academia can have differing goals and interests, they often utilize the same types of data to perform their work. As such, collaborations and partnerships between these sectors can provide outstanding opportunities to share information and establish open source information repositories. Each of these sectors also upholds different standards for data collection techniques, data transparency, and overall nutrition communication. This session comprises a panel discussion to provide an overview of the complexities that arise in data collection, management, and sharing processes through researchers' personal experiences. In addition, participants will also have the opportunity to discuss solutions and improvements in data collection and communication techniques to formulate suggestions and goals for future data sharing agreements. Overall, this session helps discuss those issues related to coordinating research and field studies as a means of improving greater collaboration and standardization of information sharing processes.

  <summary><h3 style="display:inline-block">Standardization of Anthropometric Measurements</h3></summary>
  
  Anthropometry is the basis of our present understanding of nutrition. However, questions remain about the utility, reliability, and consistency of anthropometric measurements such as mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) and body mass index (BMI). Beyond anthropometry, the relationship between populations and their nutritional status is often summarized by various nutritional markers and proportional estimates, all of which lead to questions about the generalizability and efficacy of such measures.

    <summary><h3 style="display:inline-block">Challenges in Applied Nutrition Sciences</h3></summary>

    This plenary session will be rooted in data sciences to provide an assessment of the efficacy of certain data science methodologies commonly found in nutrition research. An effort will be taken to highlight some of the differences in choices when performing data analytics and shed light on the consequences/benefits of each. As most attendees will be more rehearsed in nutrition rather than data sciences, this discussion hopes to provide participants with some of the issues that arise in the common practices taken during nutrition research. Furthermore, as the summit centers upon data sciences, this session provides greater understanding of debates in the data sciences in isolation from its role in nutrition sciences.

  <summary><h3 style="display:inline-block">Nutrition in Humanitarian Emergencies</h3></summary>
  
  The simulation exercise will focus on the theories, strategies, and nutrition data sciences occurring during nutrition emergencies, namely famine situations. To provide a holistic understanding of these event's complexities, the simulation will be broken into three parts. First, an in-depth discussion of humanitarian emergency theory will be provided to review those issues related to determining, declaring, and delivering famine response efforts. Next, working groups will be presented with information and visualizations to identify what conclusions can be made from this information according to how data was collected, recorded, organized, and communicated. The final component of this session will consist of an on-the-ground narrative by a researcher working in these conditions and the difficulty of forming a response in the moment of the crisis.

    <summary><h3 style="display:inline-block">The Future of Nutrition Technology</h3></summary>

    This plenary session will provide perspectives on the changing nature of the nutrition field. The panel will consist of nutrition technology entrepreneurs primarily from the Greater Boston area. Panelists will discuss present and upcoming advances in the nutrition field, and provide guidance for aspiring researchers and entrepreneurs on how to shape this future. This session will be followed by a professional networking event featuring startups, consultancies, and research opportunities in nutrition data sciences.
