Ryan Simpson is a second year Masters Student at the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy, enrolled in the new Nutrition Data Sciences division. As part of the [Tufts Initiative for the Forecasting and Modeling of Infectious Diseases (InForMID)](http://informid.tufts.edu/), Ryan works on forecasting infectious and foodborne diseases as well as famine humanitarian emergencies on a research grant in collaboration with the US Department of Defense’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). His work utilizes time series analysis approaches to model varying features of infectious diseases (primarily influenza) and applies these techniques for foodborne illnesses and complex emergencies. Prior to Tufts, he received two Bachelors of Arts degrees from Yale University in Environmental Engineering and Global Affairs.
