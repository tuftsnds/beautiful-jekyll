The Nutrition Data Summit 2018 Hackathon is a half-day event aimed at improving the nutrition sector through data. This interdisciplinary event unites students and faculty to apply their data analysis skills to large complex datasets curated by the NDS committee. The experimental setting provides a sandbox to test the skills learned through NDS, and tackle real challenges of missing data, irregular reporting, bias, and effective data communication. Individuals at all skill levels are welcome to participate, and statistical and programming guidance will be provided by Friedman faculty and American Statistical Association Tufts Chapter members. Collaborations made during this event can be pursued beyond the summit as individual research projects, Masters theses, or directed studies.
